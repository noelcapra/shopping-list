# Simple Shopping List in Python

A command-line program that allows users to add items to a shopping list, remove items, and display the current list. The list is managed in memory and is not saved between sessions in this version.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Download `shopping list.py`.
3. Run the program from the terminal using the command: `python "shopping list.py"`
4. Follow the menu to manage your shopping list.

## What I Learned / Concepts Demonstrated
* Using lists to store and manage data (the shopping list).
* A menu-driven interaction with the user via `input()`.
* `while` loop to keep the program running.
* `if/elif/else` statements to handle menu choices.
* Basic list operations: `append()` to add, `remove()` to delete, and iteration to display the list.
* Functions to structure the code (e.g., `shopping_list`, `want_continue1`).

## Future Improvements
* Implement file handling to save the shopping list to a file (e.g., `shopping_list.txt`) so it persists between sessions.
* Add functionality to edit existing items.
